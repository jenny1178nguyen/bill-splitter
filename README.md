# 💸 Bill Splitter

A clean, easy-to-use bill splitting calculator that does the math for you. Perfect for group dinners when you need to split the check fairly!

## ✨ Features

- **Proportional splitting** - Tax and tip are divided based on what each person actually ordered (not just split evenly)
- **Mobile-friendly** - Works perfectly on iPhone and Android
- **No installation** - Just open the HTML file in any browser
- **Multiple items per person** - Add as many items as needed for each person
- **Real-time calculations** - See exactly what everyone owes with clear breakdowns

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the [Bill Splitter](https://yourusername.github.io/bill-splitter/index.html)
2. Add people to your group
3. Enter the items each person ordered
4. Add the total tax and tip from your receipt
5. Hit "Calculate Split" and see everyone's totals!

## 💡 How It Works

The app calculates each person's share proportionally. For example:
- If you ordered $30 and your friend ordered $10 (total $40)
- You're responsible for 75% of the subtotal, tax, and tip
- Your friend is responsible for 25%

Fair splitting made simple!
